ppu.c - pixel processing unit emulation (screen driver - ppu pipeline still needs some slight work)
cpu.c - handles cpu events interrupts timers etc
memory.c - handles the gameboys memory map
instr.c - functions for the instruction set of the sm83 (add, div etc)
disass.c - disassembler used for the debugger (does not support the full instruciton set yet)
joypad.c - handles input for the emulator
opcode.c - main emulation of instrucitons executes opcodes
opcode_cb.c ^ same but for instructions prefixed with 0xcb
rom.c - handles loading the rom and pulling information out of the header the emulator requires
banking.c - handles banking switching for the rom
lib.c - various handy functions eg bit operations
